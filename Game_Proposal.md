Eventually, the player will find themselves in a trap after following an NPC's advice, however, a potato with a crudly drawn face on it will appear out of nowhere and save the group. it will then begin to follow the Heroic cat as a new pary member who plays a roll as a tank. This leads to the first miniboss of the game, the Traterus Tuco-Tuco.

After the fall of Bartholomule, the party will find out that the barron was ordered to hire the rat gang by the Cucumber King, wich only slightly increased the evil deads the barron was already doing.

Chapter 6: Post Game
this post game is more of a credits roll along with a story wrap. however, if certain conditions are met during the final Boss Fight, the player will find a dimentional tear at the very end of the credits, which leads to the true final boss, *THE HAND*, which the Cucumber King was trying to prevent from emerging.

World Setting: Fantasy

7. Gameplay Mechanics
the game is going to switch between two types of gameplay: Turn-Based during combat and an open world exploration when not in combat. during combat, the player can use skills to fight enemies and gain EXP, and Gold, while out of combat the player can spend the gold on new equipment.

8. Progression System
the player will gain EXP when completing quests given by NPCs and through combat. this EXP counts twords a total level wich gives the player skill points that can be spent to gain statpoints, and abilities.

9. Art & Visual Style
the art will be 2D pixle art of my own creation

11. Audio & Music
i will be doing all of the voice lines for the only character that has voice lines, Grump the Skeliton Murchent, who is rather chipper and sells great items. He also happens to be a very powerfull adversary if provoked. For the text sound, i will use snipit of sounds online to create them (example: sans from undertale uses a snipet of patrick star's voice from sponge bob to make sound.) Music will be created somhow (either i will make it or i will ask my dad who is a cunductor to compose a sound track)

12. Development Roadmap & Timeline
basic machanics (combat section/open world section), combat AI (enemy), shop area, battle area, figure out how to do communication with NPC's, make game have able to save progress, make menue, sprite createion/animation, creation of title screen, sit back and sleep :D.

13. Technical Requirements
game engin: Godot
coding language: the language Godot uses
Device needed: computer
Other: my brain and AI

14. Closing Statement
